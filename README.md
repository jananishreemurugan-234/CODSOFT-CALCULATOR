# CODSOFT-CALCULATOR

## Project Overview 
The **Codsoft Scientific Calculator** is a colorful and fully functional desktop application created using **Python** and **Tkinter**. 
It supports both basic arithmetic operations and advanced scientific functions such as trigonometry, logarithms, and exponentials. 
The application was designed as part of the **Codsoft Internship Program** to demonstrate practical programming concepts like **GUI development**, **mathematical computations**, and **user-friendly design**. 

This project shows how Python can be used to create real-world tools that are both functional and visually appealing. 

## Objective 
The goal of this project is to create a **scientific calculator** that helps students, developers, and professionals perform quick and accurate calculations. 
While standard calculators only handle basic arithmetic, this application includes **scientific features** such as square roots, trigonometric functions, and logarithmic operations, all in one lightweight program. 
It also focuses on **intuitive button design and colorful UI elements**, making it more engaging and easier to use than plain-text calculators. 

## Features 
- **Basic Arithmetic** – Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, percentage, parentheses, and decimals. 
- **Power & Root Functions** – Square (`x²`) and Square Root (`√`). 
- **Trigonometric Functions** – Sine, Cosine, and Tangent (in degrees). 
- **Logarithmic Functions** – Base-10 logarithm (`log`) and natural log (`ln`). 
- **Exponential Functions** – `eˣ` and `10ˣ` calculations. 
- **Control Buttons** – Clear (`C`), Backspace (`⌫`), and Equal (`=`). 
- **Colorful Interface** – Different button colors for numbers, operators, trigonometry, and logs for a modern, intuitive look.

## User Interface Design 
The calculator uses a **grid layout** of buttons with a stylish entry display at the top. 
- The entry box shows the current expression or result. 
- Number buttons are in **pink**, operator buttons in **yellow**, equal button in **pink**, clear in **yellow**, and trigonometric/log functions in **sky blue**. 
- This color-coding helps users quickly identify different functions. 
- The overall background is a light shade (`#0AD9FD`), which makes the bright buttons stand out clearly. 

## How It Works 
1. The user enters expressions by clicking buttons on the interface. 
2. Clicking `=` evaluates the expression using Python’s math library. 
3. Special buttons (`sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `log`, `ln`, `√`, `x²`, `eˣ`, `10ˣ`) perform advanced calculations. 
4. `C` clears the entire expression, while `⌫` deletes the last character. 
5. Results are displayed instantly in the top entry box. 

## How to Run 
1. Ensure **Python 3.13.7** is installed on your system. 
2. Clone or download this repository. 
3. Open the terminal/command prompt in the project folder. 
4. Run the program: 
   ```bash
   python calculator.py
5. The Scientific Calculator window will appear.

## Conclusion
The Codsoft Calculator Project helped me strengthen my Python and Tkinter skills by creating a fully functional scientific calculator. It enhanced my problem-solving abilities while giving me practical experience in GUI design, user interaction, and arithmetic operations.
